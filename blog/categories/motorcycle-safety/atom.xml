    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I came across <a href="http://dontai.com/wp/2010/05/20/motorcycle-helmet-impact-zones">this diagram</a> on the internet a few weeks ago. While it peaked my interest, I thought it might be worthwhile to update and improve the presentation a bit (with some number rounding).</p>




<p>So, here's a short infographic showing what the most common impact zones are on your helmet. I've also included some general
    accident statistics for you to digest.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>


<ul>
    <li>Almost half (46%) of impacts to your motorcycle helmet strike at your chin/face, <b>an area not protected by half helmets.</b></li>
    <li>Most riders who end up in an accident have less than 5 months experience (are new). Be VERY careful as you're just starting out.</li>
    <li>Wearing a helmet significantly reduces the risk of serious injury in a motorcycle accident. (Not surprising.)</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Something I’ve often said to myself while getting on the back of my bike is, “I wonder how dangerous this really is”.</p>


<p></p>

<p>It seems like every time I tell someone that I ride, they’re quick to respond with a statement like, 
“Oh, my uncle’s best friend died in a motorcycle accident.”</p>


<p></p>

<p>I’m not sure why non-riders seem to jump at the opportunity to share this type of information with me, 
but, I get it - riding is dangerous. We all know it on some level or another. But how dangerous is it?</p>


<p></p>

<p>Well, it’s time to be rid of the mystery. I’ve collected some statistics regarding the likelihood of 
fatally injuring yourself while engaged in motorcycle riding (and various other adventurous activities). 
While this doesn’t really account for miles traveled, years of experience, age, etc… it will at least give 
you a ballpark figure.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Chances of Dying While...</h3>




<h4>Driving</h4>


<p>1 in 7,142</p>




<h4>Rock Climbing</h4>


<p>1 in 1,750</p>




<h4>Skydiving</h4>


<p>1 in 142,800</p>




<h4>Scuba diving</h4>


<p></p>

<p>1 in 34,400</p>




<h4>Boxing</h4>


<p>1 in 2,197</p>




<h4>Bungee Jumping</h4>


<p>1 in 500,000</p>




<h4>Motorcycling</h4>


<p>1 in 1,369</p>




<p>These numbers definitely held some surprises for me. For example, I never realized how safe skydiving actually is! (Time to do it.) 
Secondly, motorcycle riding is definitely the most dangerous of the activities listed.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Stay safe out there. Wear your gear!</p>
