  <div class="entry-content"><p>The numbers don’t lie. In 2010 there were over 100,000 serious motorcycle accidents in the United States. 
4,502 of those were fatal to the rider or passenger. This shouldn’t come as a shock; we all know riding is dangerous. 
In fact, for many of us that’s part of why we do it. If motorcycling wasn’t thrilling 
(and by extension, somewhat dangerous) many of us would probably skip out.</p>




<p>However, I’d like to die old-ish. And, I imagine you would as well.</p>


<p></p>

<p>In 1981, a comprehensive study was published on motorcycle accidents, 
their causes (and results). What we can pull from this study, are a few actions we can take as 
riders to mitigate our risk of becoming a statistic. Read on my friend.</p>




<h3>1. Be Vigilant Around Home</h3>


<p><blockqote>“Most motorcycle accidents involve a short trip associated with shopping, errands, friends, entertainment or recreation,
and the accident is likely to happen in very short time close to the trip origin.“ &ndash; The Hurt Report</blockquote></p>

<p>We’ve all been there. You did an oil change, and just want to take the bike for a quick spin. 
Or, you’ve got a quick milk run to do, and the store is only a few miles away from home. The routine nature of these 
trips often makes us feel more secure than we really are. Sometimes we even forego some gear to get on the road faster. 
However, the majority of motorcycle accidents, even fatal ones, happen close to the point of origin. 
Be EXTRA vigilant in your local area. Letting your guard down or not wearing your gear could invite an otherwise less likely incident.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>2. Prep That Clutch When You See A Car Making a Left</h3>


<p><blockqote>“The most frequent accident configuration is the motorcycle proceeding straight then the automobile
makes a left turn in front of the oncoming motorcycle.“ &ndash; The Hurt Report</blockquote></p>

<p>Any time a car is making a left that will cross your path of travel, be prepared for them to cut you off. 
For me, this usually means I’m covering the clutch and brakes as I move through intersections or busy streets 
where vehicles often pull out. If the driver doesn’t see you, there’s a good chance you’re in for some split-second 
decision making. Best to be ready.</p>




<h3>3. Take a Motorcycle Safety Course</h3>


<p><blockqote>“92% of those in an accident hadn’t taken any kind of safety course&hellip;” &ndash; The Hurt Report</blockquote></p>

<p>My best guess would be that years of riding and experience would be worth more than any motorcycle 
safety course, but most accidents happen to new riders. So, if you’re just getting started, take a safety course.</p>


<p></p>

<p>This will often get you an insurance discount as well (depending on the state).</p>




<p>Avoiding an accident in your first two years of riding is a major accomplishment. 
Doing everything in your power to make that happen is well worth the effort.</p>




<h3>4. Stick with H2O</h3>


<p><blockqote>“Almost half of the fatal accidents show alcohol involvement.“ &ndash; The Hurt Report</blockquote></p>

<p>I was surprised it was that many.</p>


<p></p>

<p>I’ve ridden my bike out with a friend or two to have a brew before, but I’d say this is 
generally a poor decision. Even drinking lightly and giving yourself plenty of time for sobriety, 
seems like an unnecessary risk given the statistic above. Skip the booze. Riding is fun enough on its own.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Don’t play with fire.</p>




<h3>5. Playa, Wear Your Damn Helmet</h3>


<p><blockqote>“Safety helmet use caused no attenuation of critical traffic sounds, no limitation of pre-crash
visual field, and no fatigue or loss of attention; no element of accident causation was related to helmet use.“ &ndash; The Hurt Report</blockquote></p>

<p>Wearing a helmet does not put you at greater risk of having an accident. Counter to the purpose of 
this post, it also doesn’t really help you PREVENT an accident. However, if the shit does hit the fan, 
the most common serious injuries to riders involve brain injuries or death. The only defense you have against this is a helmet. Please wear one.</p>


<p></p>

<p>As a former EMT, I can attest to the fact that nobody wants to show up to your accident scene and 
find your grey matter splattered all over the pavement. Seriously, not pretty.</p>




<p>Buy it. Wear it.</p>
