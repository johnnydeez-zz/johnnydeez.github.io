<p>I came across <a href="http://dontai.com/wp/2010/05/20/motorcycle-helmet-impact-zones">this diagram</a> on the internet a few weeks ago. While it peaked my interest, I thought it might be worthwhile to update and improve the presentation a bit (with some number rounding).</p>

<p>So, here's a short infographic showing what the most common impact zones are on your helmet. I've also included some general
	accident statistics for you to digest.</p>

<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Almost half (46%) of impacts to your motorcycle helmet strike at your chin/face, <b>an area not protected by half helmets.</b></li>
	<li>Most riders who end up in an accident have less than 5 months experience (are new). Be VERY careful as you're just starting out.</li>
	<li>Wearing a helmet significantly reduces the risk of serious injury in a motorcycle accident. (Not surprising.)</li>
</ul>
